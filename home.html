            <h3>MS Dhoni smashes own record as IPL 2023 viewership reaches new high during his CSK skipper's '3-ball, 2 sixes' vs LSG . The Dhoni magic was not limited to Chepauk. How could it be? The Dhoni devotion knows no boundaries. The viewership on Jio Cinema - IPL's digital broadcasters - touched 1.7 crore - the highest so far in IPL 2023. Dhoni broke his own record. The previous record was 1.6 crore. Guess what? It was Dhoni at the crease at that time too, against the Gujarat Titans in the tournament opener.

            <h4>Posted on Apr 04, 2023</h4>
            <h3>Former Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad on Tuesday heaped praises on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, calling him a statesman who never took any revenge despite the former attacking him on issues like Article 370, Citizenship Amendment Act or hijab row.

                “I must give credit to Modi. For what I did to him, he was too generous. As Leader of the Opposition I did not spare him on any issue be it Article 370 or CAA or hijab. I got some Bills totally failed but I must give him the credit that he behaved like a statesman, not taking revenge for that”, Azad told ANI in an interview.
